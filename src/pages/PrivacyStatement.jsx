                    <p>
                        When you purchase anything from our website, as part of the buying and selling process,
                        we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.
                        When you browse our website, we also automatically receive your computerâ€™s internet protocol

                        and operating system.

                        If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure
                        socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with 2FA encryption with our trusted merchant providers.
